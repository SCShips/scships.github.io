            <h1>Ship Tracker</h1>
            <p>Managing your fleet in Star Citizen can be a challenge, especially after a soft wipe when all of your ship components reset. This ship tracker simplifies fleet management by keeping your ship information organized without the hassle of using spreadsheets.
                <br>
                <br>With this tool, you can easily track your ship's guns, quantum drives, and paints. One notable feature is the Quantum Button, which visually shows whether your quantum drive is installed — green for installed, red for not installed — keeping you from finding yourself in a 20 minute QT on accident.
                <br>
                <br>Additionally, when hovering over the quantum button, the location to purchase the drive appears at the top of the screen. Currently, the tool includes info for the fastest drives, but by editing the quantum_drives.json file, you can add purchase locations for any drive you'd like. It also helps you stay on top of which aUEC ships you’re planning to purchase and whether you’ve already acquired them.
                <br>
                <br>No more scrambling to remember your fleet details after a reset. This tool makes managing your fleet easy and efficient.
                <br>
                <br>This project runs in a javascript stack utilizing node.js. Readme included for run instructions.</p>
